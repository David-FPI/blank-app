## About Me

ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm **Sushovan Saha**, a **Machine Learning (ML)** enthusiast specializing in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and Computer Vision (CV). I did my M.Tech in **Data Science** from **IIT Guwahati**. I am also a **Kaggle Notebook Expert**.

ðŸŒŸ I'm passionate about exploring the possibilities of ML to solve real-world problems and improve people's lives. I love working on challenging projects that require me to stretch my abilities and learn new things.

ðŸ“š In my free time, I like to contribute in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/sushovansaha9), Write ML blogs in [Medium](https://medium.com/@sushovansaha95), read ML related blogs and updates. I'm always looking for ways to stay up-to-date with the latest developments in the field.
